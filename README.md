## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

defining a the project scope for a given software project gives the precise definition of the project being worked on giving a clear view of the requirements of the project establishing clear boundaries,deliverables and expectations which is importatant for resource allocation,time management and stack-holder communication thus increasing the chances of project success.Establishes Clear Boundaries and Expectations a well-defined scope outlines what the project will and will not include, preventing scope creep and ensuring that the project stays focused on its objectives. It clarifies the deliverables, tasks, and resources required, providing a clear roadmap for the project team. By defining the scope, stakeholders have a shared understanding of what to expect, leading to better communication and alignment.Facilitates Effective Planning and Resource Allocation a clear scope allows for accurate estimation of project timelines, costs, and resource requirements. It helps in identifying potential risks and challenges early on, enabling proactive risk management and mitigation strategies. With a well-defined scope, project managers can make informed decisions about resource allocation, ensuring that the right resources are available at the right time.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a project management tool that breaks down a project's scope into smaller, more manageable components, providing a hierarchical view of the work required to achieve project objectives.The purpose of a Work Breakdown Structure in project management is to organize and define the project scope by breaking it down into manageable components, facilitating planning, execution, and control. 

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Developing a detailed project schedule helps you keep up with the time limits of the project and the due dates put in place for the components of tthe project you are working on.A detailed project schedule allows for accurate estimation of the project timeline thus making iit easy to work on the components of the project that are required in quick time frames.Then when challanges arise that deter the project development face a well defined project schedule will allow for such instances thus having time for setbacks is always a great idea in the project schedule.
Gantt charts are visualition of what the project plan will look like by giving a precise look at tasks their duration,status and priority,stating start and end dates for the project giving you the progress report and time line for he project with a time scale showing the milestones reached and the dealines that are set,it gives you a look at the dependencies between tasks.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The issues that our software project aims to address are in the health department systems,due to many factors that the health department faces factors like delays in DNA samples,mis-diagnosis and unidentified bodies at hospitals.The software we developed aims to address such factors by having a database of all south african citizens by keeping a record of a citizens medical history and the hereditary records of the family tree thus making it easy for medical practionars to make substantial diagnosis that are evidence based.And when the is unfortunate situation like those of having unidentified deceased citizen the database can be used to locate the family of the deceased through the family relation part of the software where the is a record of every citizens immediate and relative family.

The South African health department as of today has a staggering 3 186 number of unclaimed deceased bodies that is a high number for a 4th industrial revolution country with all the technology in the world and a high chance of getting misdiagnosed in South Africa due to the high number of patiants in our hospitals thus a system that relates your DNA to your blood type,medical history and hereditary history that will minimize the number of unwanted issues like medical negligence and malpractise which are on a rise in South Africa.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining a problem allows developers understand the issues that the software is solving thus allowing the developers to focusing more on developing a software that is based on the problem.Giving clear definition of the problem allows developers to know all the details that have to be work on in the project thus then having a project tha solves the defined problem.That helps in mitigating the use of the budget of the development phase of the project and minimizing arguments between developers when they work on the project since the would be a clear definition of whats being developed.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
The software project i am developing is a system that is meant to make the work of all medical practionars simple without any wrong doing and malpractise since the medical field is a high intansity enviroment that requires precise decisions that can impact a persons life at any moment, that is why any wrong doing has to be mitigated at all cost, thus having a system that provides evidence for your medical decisions is crucial in that field.
